 THE GAME IS A SIDE SPAWNER. YOU ARE A SUBMARINE. YOUR AIM IS TO STAY ALIVE BY AVOIDING FISH AND SHARKS THAT COME TOWARDS YOU!
 
 ALL ASSETS CAME FROM THE UNITY STORE.
 ALL CODE IS BASED OFF THE CREATE WITH CODE EXCEPT FOR THE RANDOMSPAWN WHICH WE TRIED SOMETHING NEW FOR THE ALPHA VERSION... 
 WE HAVE SINCE REVERTED BACK TO CODE WE LEARNT FROM THE CREATE WITH CODE COURSE FOR THE BETA VERSION OF THE GAME!
